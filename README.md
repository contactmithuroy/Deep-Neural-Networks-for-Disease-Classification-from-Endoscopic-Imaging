## The notebook is organized as follows:

Data Preprocessing: Loads and preprocesses the images and masks.

Model Definition: Defines and compiles the U-Net model.

Training: Trains the model on the preprocessed data.

Evaluation: Evaluates the model and displays metrics like accuracy, loss, and AUC.

Predictions and Visualizations: Shows example predictions with Grad-CAM visualizations for model interpretation. Results

## Results
Accuracy: 94%
AUC (ROC curve): 0.97
Example Predictions: The model successfully segments key regions in endoscopic images. See the notebook for example outputs, including Grad-CAM visualizations.
